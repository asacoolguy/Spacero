Spacero Design Doc version 2

Description
- 2D mobile local multiplayer game 
- Like Warioware but in SPACE
- Difference from other mini-game games:
	same controls from stage to stage

Game Modes
- 1p practice mode: practice stages by yourself and try to get high scores
- 2p tournament mode: play through a series of maps with friend
	player can choose best 2 out of 3, 3 out of 5, 4 out of 7
	each map has a different objective. tournament will try to use maps with different 
		objectives. each object should have a few maps with randomized things.

Basic Gameplay (common across all objectives)
- Planets orbit in space
	asteroids: fast rotation, small gravity, used for orientation and position
	big planets: slow rotation, big gravity, used for orbital runs
		sometimes contains coins or powerups (you can tell by the sprite)
	Space debris: varid rotation speed, cannot land. bounces players off
	Blackholes: no rotation, big gravity, used for orbital runs
		kills players that get too slow
	Deathplanets: rotates slowly, periodically shoots out destructive beams to avoid
- Press space to jump
	tap to jump at a slow speed, hold and release for fast charged jump
	jumping off planets damages it. 
		small planets will explode (and respawn)
		bigger planets will crack and then explode (and respawn)
- Kill other players 
	either by blowing up the planet they're on
	or jump running into them at a higher speed
- Collect things by flying into them
	coins, power ups, etc
	rack up combos for coins for more points
- Orbital slings
	aim slightly off a big planet to use the planet's gravity to change your flight course
	used to get to otherwise inaccessible locations
- Special skills
	default skill is to slowly fly towards nearest planet
	use powerups to get new skills 
		dash forward
		hookshot
		enlarge
