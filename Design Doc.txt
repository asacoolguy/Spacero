Description
- 2d mobile local multiplayer game
- 3 modes: tutorial, single player, local multiplayer-> same phone and/or bluetooth


Basic Gameplay
- planets orbit in space
	bigger planets rotate baster, slower ones rotate slower
	TODO: orbiting moons
- goal is to collect coins. when all coins are gone. person with more coins wins. 
	when you kill another player, you get some of his coins
- press space to blow up a planet and jump away
	bigger planet = more jump power
	if another player is on the planet you blow up, they die. you get some of their coins. 
		dead players respawn after X seconds.
- power levels (maybe call this gravity power gauge)
	power level charges while landed and depletes when drifting.
		bigger planet = charges faster. 
	taking off consumes power (say 25%), no matter planet size. 
		this incentivizes players to use big planets to charge and small ones to angle themselves
	ALTERNATIVELY: no powerlevel, tap to jump a little, hold and release to charge and jump a lot
		this incentivizes the player to not jump spam, because the small jump can only get you so far
			note: captain space's jetpack would make the jump distance limit obsolete
- if player knocks into other players
	player with more speed wins
- character based powers
	every characters gets 1 special power 
	jetpack: dash forward 
	hook: shoot a hook on the left side, if grab something then go there
	puff: increase in size briefly
	teleport: drop a marker while drifting, instantly return there 
- power ups
	barrier
	fast jump charge
	extra speed
	coin magnet
- new ideas
	set a time limit per game, say 1 min. planets/powerups/coins continue to respawn.
		after time is up, player with most points win. 
	blackholes that lead to perma death
	barriers that you bounce off
	
	
	
Game modes
- free play mode->pick any character and any map
- tournament mode-> random maps and modes
	

To do
- implement power ups
- Remake HUD
	button should react when pressed, shake when can't be pressed
- rethink about the powerlevel thing
	
- better death animation when players wins through collision
- move game states into event system
- make a proper menu
- implement different characters
- character selection
- Walls that you bounce off


Phases
- phase 1: basic game for alpha testing -- 1 week, by 10/27
	- code refactored
	- gravity function re-implemented
	- power ups and planet cracking implemented
	- moons that rotate around things
	- redesign basic map
	- better HUD
- phase 2: prettify the game -- 2 weeks, by 11/10
	- investigate 3d vs 2d
		that martian game with tiny astronauts seem cool
	- think of art style that makes the game seem unique and cool looking
	- make assets
		power ups
		coins
		space background
		planets
		astronauts
		HUD
		sound effects & animaions
	- make a few more maps
- phase 3: menu -- 1 week, by 11/17
	- make a proper menu 
		tutorial, local versus, settings, credits 
	- pause menu during the game
	- map selection, character selection
- phase 4: expansion
	- more characters, more maps
	- simple progression system
	- local practice mode with AI?


BUGs
- sometimes after colliding with a player on a planet, the winner would just float	

	
Endless runner idea
- goal is to travel as far as possible
	left and right side wraps, hitting top or bottom makes you lose
	camera is fixed and recentered everytime you land on a planet. 
		new base planet is placed on the bottom of the screen, so you only ever go up
- collect coins
	float around planets, you can fly directing into them on the way to another planet
	bonus points for collecting multiple in a row
- orbitng
	collecting coins via orbiting gives you bonus points?
	bonus points for flying by a planet without landing?
