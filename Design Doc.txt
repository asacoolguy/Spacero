Description
- 2d mobile local multiplayer game
- 3 modes: tutorial, single player, local multiplayer-> same phone and/or bluetooth


Basic Gameplay
- planets orbit in space
	bigger planets rotate baster, slower ones rotate slower
	TODO: orbiting moons
- goal is to collect coins. when all coins are gone. person with more coins wins. 
	when you kill another player, you get some of his coins
- press space to blow up a planet and jump away
	bigger planet = more jump power
	if another player is on the planet you blow up, they lose a life and you get extra points
		dead characters respawn after X seconds
	when a player dies 3 times, game is over, player with more points win
- power levels (maybe call this gravity power gauge)
	CURRENT PLAN: blowing up planets rewards power levels to player
		bigger planet = more power
		power level decreases while in flight but not while landed
		power level determines who wins during a collision
		analaysis: this encourages players to go for big planets for power and use small
			planets for orientation. but there is nothing stopping players from button mashing.
			we need some sort of limit to stop button mashing, but not too much to disturb the fast
			pace feeling of the game. also we need a better way than the insta death mechanic.
	ALTERNATE plan: power level charges while landed and depletes when drifting.
		bigger planet = charges faster. 
		taking off consumes power (say 25%), no matter planet size. 
			this incentivizes players to use big planets to charge and small ones to angle themselves
		replace insta-death on launch mechanic with...
			plan 1: have a health bar. being blown off decreases health by 1 out of 3. 
				player collision is still instakill for player with more oxigen
			plan 2: take the mutual 25% hit to your oxigen/power level. if it reaches 0 you die. 
				this makes players want to stay on planets to charge
			plan 3: take the mutual 25% hit to power level. have another attack bar.
				power level charges on all planets and depletes while drifting or being on red planets. 
				attack bar charges while drifting and does not deplete. 
				during collision, player with higher attack bar wins. 
			plan 4: getting killed just means you lose some of your coins to your attacker.
				you respawn after X seconds. 
- if player knocks into other players
	while on a planet, the player on the planet gets bounced off
	while drifting, insta death
- character based powers
	every characters gets 1 special power 
	jetpack: dash forward 
	lockdown: place a planet on lockdown and blast off. next person on the planet gets stuck for X seconds
- power ups
	double coins
	full oxigen
	extra speed
	coin magnet
	
	
Competitive play
- free play mode->pick any character and any map
- tournament-> random maps and modes
	

To do
- refactor code
	- rename variables and methods, delete extra code
	- move things into event system
		gamestates, hud, player respawn, etc
	- change planetRespawn so that it is based on size

- redo planets and gravitational pull calculation
- implement power ups
- implement planet cracking
- redo maps
- Remake HUD
	button should react when pressed, shake when can't be pressed
- better death animation when players wins through collision
- make a proper menu
- implement different characters
- character selection
- Walls that you bounce off


Phases
- phase 1: basic game for alpha testing -- 1 week, by 10/27
	- code refactored
	- gravity function re-implemented
	- power ups and planet cracking implemented
	- redesign basic map
	- better HUD
- phase 2: prettify the game -- 2 weeks, by 11/10
	- investigate 3d vs 2d
		that martian game with tiny astronauts seem cool
	- think of art style that makes the game seem unique and cool looking
	- make assets
		power ups
		coins
		space background
		planets
		astronauts
		HUD
		sound effects & animaions
	- make a few more maps
- phase 3: menu -- 1 week, by 11/17
	- make a proper menu 
		tutorial, local versus, settings, credits 
	- pause menu during the game
	- map selection, character selection
- phase 4: expansion
	- more characters, more maps
	- simple progression system
	- local practice mode with AI?
