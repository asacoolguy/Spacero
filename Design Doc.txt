Description
- 2d mobile local multiplayer game
- 3 modes: tutorial, single player, local multiplayer-> same phone and/or bluetooth


Basic Gameplay
- planets orbit in space
	bigger planets rotate baster, slower ones rotate slower
	TODO: orbiting moons
- press space to blow up a planet and jump away
	bigger planet = more jump power
	if another player is on the planet you blow up, they lose a life and you get extra points
		dead characters respawn after X seconds
	when a player dies 3 times, game is over, player with more points win
- power levels (maybe call this gravity power gauge)
	CURRENT PLAN: blowing up planets rewards power levels to player
		bigger planet = more power
		power level decreases while in flight but not while landed
		power level determines who wins during a collision
		analaysis: this encourages players to go for big planets for power and use small
			planets for orientation
	ALTERNATE plan: power level charges while landed. 
		bigger planet = charges faster
		taking off has limited charges that replenish. 
		power level determines who wins during a collision
		analysis: this slows the game down and encourages players to carefully aim more. maybe not fun.
- character based powers
	every characters gets 1 special power 
	jetpack: dash forward 
	lockdown: place a planet on lockdown and blast off. next person on the planet gets stuck for X seconds
- power ups
	double points for planets
	extra life
	extra speed
	
	
Competitive play
- free play mode->pick any character and any map
- tournament-> random maps and modes
	

To do
- redo planets and gravitational pull calculation
- implement power ups
- redo maps
- Remake HUD
	button should react when pressed, shake when can't be pressed
- make a proper menu
- implement different characters
- character selection

- Walls that you bounce off
